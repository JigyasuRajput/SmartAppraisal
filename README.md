# Django Web Application Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Django web application locally. The project includes the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (default)

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **pip**: Python package installer (comes with Python)
- **Django**: Web framework for Python

You can check if these are installed by running:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

- For **Windows**:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

- For **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- For **Windows**:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- For **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is active, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Django and any other packages required for the project.

### 4. Set Up the Database

- The application uses SQLite as the default database, which is simple to set up and doesn’t require additional configuration.
- Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser

If you want to access the Django admin panel, you need to create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up the superuser account (username, email, and password).

### 6. Run the Development Server

To start the server locally, run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server, and you should see output similar to:

```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

You can now open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the application.

### 7. Access the Admin Panel (Optional)

To access the Django admin panel, go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

Login with the superuser credentials you created earlier.

## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the project structure:

```
your-repository-name/
│
├── manage.py                 # Django project management script
├── requirements.txt          # List of dependencies for the project
├── .venv/                    # Virtual environment folder
├── app_name/                 # Your Django app(s)
│   ├── migrations/           # Database migration files
│   ├── models.py             # Database models
│   ├── views.py              # Views for handling requests
│   ├── templates/            # HTML templates for the frontend
│   └── static/               # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
│
└── db.sqlite3                # SQLite database file
```

- **`static/`**: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
- **`templates/`**: Contains HTML files.
- **`models.py`**: Defines the database structure.
- **`views.py`**: Handles the logic for rendering HTML templates or API responses.

---

## Frontend Setup

If you have a separate HTML, CSS, or JavaScript frontend, ensure the following:

- Static files like CSS and JS should be placed in the `static/` folder.
- HTML files should be placed in the `templates/` folder, and they will be rendered by Django views.

---

## Common Commands

- **Start the server**: `python manage.py runserver`
- **Make migrations**: `python manage.py makemigrations`
- **Apply migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
- **Create superuser**: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- **Check for errors**: `python manage.py check`

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError` for `django`**  
   If you see this error, ensure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Database errors**  
   If you encounter database errors, try running `python manage.py migrate` again.

3. **Static files not loading**  
   Make sure static files are in the correct folders (`static/` for CSS, JS, images) and properly linked in your HTML files.

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up the Django web application locally. Now you can begin developing, testing, and deploying your project!
